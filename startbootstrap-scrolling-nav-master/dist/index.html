                    <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
                    <p class="lead">I started each day at 8am. Not even early haha. The morning is focused on stacking
                        dubs. By the time I get on the doors, I need to have a couple wins under my belts so my mind is
                        right.
                        If I got these things done in the morning, I knew it was going to be a successful day:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Read my scriptures and pray to connect with God. He is my strength and the only reason I
                            have this opportunity.</li>
                        <li>Work out. It was usually pretty short. 4 exercises with 3 sets each. I focused on mobility
                            and core strength.</li>
                        <li>Stretch. This helped me stop, think, and get my body feeling extra lose for the day. </li>
                        <li>Shower and get ready. They say you only perform as good as you look HAHA! And I was looking
                            fine!</li>
                        <li>Eat breakfast. Most important meal fo the day folks. </li>

                    <p class="lead">Morning meeting started at 10am at the office. This wasn't just a time to hang out
                        like most other companies do. This is where we train and get better because at the Grit, wer're
                        different. 1-2 hours of training and then Los or Dan would break us down with crazy
                        hype!<br><br>OFF TO HOOD BABY!</p>

                    <p class="lead">We would get on the doors as quick as possible after meeting so usually 11:30-12:30.
                        This is what we live for. Getting better every day, working 100% all the time, becoming the best
                        versions of ourselves, and making tons of money! The mental demons on the doors are like none
                        other. It takes a soldier to get through. But it's so fun once you get good at it. We knock
                        until 9:30 every night no matter what.</p>

                    <p class="lead">We stop every night at 9:30. Unless your car partner isn't there to pick you up yet
                        which is basically every night! WHAT A BLESSING! More time on the doors baby! And if you get
                        nightcrawler (the latest deal), you get to shoot for $50 the next day at morning meeting.
                        <br><br>Alright for real. Night is super chill. We drive home, usually get dinner on the way,
                        and hit the hay as soon as possible haha. Sometimes we cook or play games to spice things up.
                        But life really is just a grind and we love it! That makes the off-season that much better!</p>
